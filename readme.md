# Crossword Player

##Motivation

This was my capstone project through the Flatiron School, where we were tasked with creating a project utilizing React-Redux with a Ruby on Rails backend. I love playing crosswords, so I wanted to task myself with seeing if I could create one myself.

##Tech/Framework

This project runs on Ruby, Rails 6.0, React-Redux 7.2.0

##Installation

After cloning the repository, simply run bundle install in the backend folder. 

##How To Use

My backend is currently hosted in Heroku, and soon will be hosting the frontend in Github pages. Utilize npm start to run the application currently.

Begin by creating a username, then access one of the links to the crosswords to begin playing!
